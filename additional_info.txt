now I've cloned the repo and am working on it locally and will try things like git fetch and git push.

throwing this in here to hopefully create a merge conflict.

Now I've created feature branch feature A for experimentation w/ remotes and tracking etc.

Making a another commit on feature A for fetch experiment.

A change to experiment with mergetool, trying to create a conflict.

This is an edit on branch master.
